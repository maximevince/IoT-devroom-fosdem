# FOSDEM Internet of Things devroom

In February 2018, we're organizing the fifth FOSDEM devroom for the Internet of Things. We're now calling for proposals. Do you have an interesting project you'd like to present to more than 5,000 free and open source developers?

### Introduction
FOSDEM (Free and Open source Software Developers' European Meeting) is a non-commercial, volunteer organized European event centered around free and open source software development. It is aimed at developers and anyone interested in the free and open source software movement. It aims to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software.

For general news and discussion on FOSDEM, please sign-up to the fosdem@lists.fosdem.org mailing list at: https://lists.fosdem.org/listinfo.

FOSDEM is held annually during the first weekend of February at the Université Libre de Bruxelles Solbosch campus, situated in the southeast of Brussels, Belgium and easily reachable by public transport from Brussels-Central railway station.
The FOSDEM devrooms are whole-day tracks focused on one topic, aimed at developers. For the the third time, we're organizing an Internet of Things devroom at FOSDEM. As Helen Duce said, "We have a clear vision: to create a world where every object — from jumbo jets to sewing needles — is linked to the Internet."

Thousands of keen developers come to FOSDEM. There's no better event in Europe for reaching out to free and open source developers.

### Date
The IoT devroom will be on Sunday 4th February, 2018.

### How to Submit a Proposal
If you have an IoT project you'd like to present, please submit it via FOSDEM's Pentabarf web tool. You will create an account (if you don't have one from a previous year), and select the "Internet of Things devroom" as the track. 
Every submission received will be reviewed and we’ll then make a selection from all the submitted proposals.

We're looking for talks that cover one or more of the following topics:
* FOSS solutions for machine-to-machine communication on small embedded devices.
* Distributed FOSS applications in any field of interest for autonomous/self-controlled devices, (e.g. domotics, automotive, etc.
* Presentation of embedded devices with one or more possibilities to join a network.
* Infrastructure related (TCP/IP, mesh networking, message queuing, cross-layer solutions).
* Real-life problematics and their solution (Cost of maintenance, power management, reachability).
* Interoperability solutions for heterogeneous applications, devices, protocols, media.

All presentations must be fully FOSS, and related to software development.

The devroom will last one day, approx from 10.30 until 18:00. Talks will last 25 minutes each, starting on the hour, with a 5-minute break between talks. There will be no break for lunch.

Speakers should respect the following talk format: a five to ten minute demo (live demo preferred over pre-recorded), followed by five to ten minutes of explanation, and then five minutes for Q&A with the audience. Make sure you stick to your 25 minute time slot. All talks are recorded and streamed live, and by submitting a talk you agree to this.

We want to make this devroom as interesting and diverse as possible, which means we will favor talks that contrast each other.

The deadline for submissions is December 1st. If you submit late, your talk may still be considered but will have to be exceptionally interesting. The program will be finalized by December 30th.
